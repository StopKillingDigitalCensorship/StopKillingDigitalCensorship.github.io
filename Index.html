    Stop Killing Digital Freedom

    <p>
        "Stop Killing Digital Freedom" (or SKDF) si an initiative started to challege the recently appointed censorship 
        laws around the western states. We have an ingrisingly amount of states that are upholding this law, 
        with vague points and without being trasparet to the public. This laws, like the UK's "children online safety act", 
        the US's "kids online safety act", the US's "BEARD", the EU proposal to imposing ID age verification by the start 
        of October 2025 and the Australian's Draconian laws, all points to monitor and strip the peoples residing in this countries
        the privacy, the freedom of speech, expression and information that are alegedly uphold by this countries governments.
        As democratic states, these bills, acts and laws, are all started without the knowledge and the sustain of the public, 
        with a misleading objective that, ironically, does the complete opposite by exposing more sensible data to third, malicious, 
        parties, all in name of repression and control.
        Also, recently, with the mastercard/visa scandal about the imposed censorship on videogames that are deemed only by a single 
        party "problematic", for now this has only being applied to entertainment and media like manga, anime and videogames, but 
        by how the terms of service are drafted, this could lead to political censorship if someone ideology is considered "problematic"
        to visa and mastercard.
        With this we are asking the EU, in prevention of this kind of problematic behaviour from government parties all around the world,
        to put in place laws to do just that, and, stop this censorship plague from spreading further.

        In Europe, this is the best course of action for now, it's the only way to appeal to this sensless censorships and attack 
        on free speech, online security and privacy. in the UK it's possible to make a petition, but for how things are made in the UK,
        the petition is not going to be taken into consideration and the parliment will refuse to take any action. In the US, 
        the "KOSA" has only been proposed and it's not yet a law, and even there, no citizen pushed for it. The "BEARD" instaed,
        not only gives corporations a onesided power to take down sites that "infrange" their copyrights, 
        but they also target foreign sites and providers, which is a huge overreach. 
        This initiative for now is only on the EU side, but we are hoping to expand it to other countries not in the EU in the future.
